NAME
	DNAsm - something stupid you won't need in the near future

SYNOPSIS
	dnasm [--input <path>] [--output <path>] [--manual] [--compress] [--rna]

DESCRIPTION
	An assembler like nasm for genetic related things. You can use it for building RNA/DNA and insert
	useful macros for e.g. building CRISPR-Cas9.

OPTIONS
	--input <path>
		Path of the input file.
	--output <path>
		Path for the output.
	--manual
		Displays this.
	--compress
		Outputs a smaller version of the compiled dna/rna (it uses 2 bits per base)
	--rna
		Replaces all "t" with "u"

ASM-COMMANDS
	Note: commands starting with % are processed by the preprocessor
	%include <path>
		Inserts the assembler from the given file into the current place.
	bases <bases>
		Adds raw bases (e.g. taa)
	start
		Adds start bases (atg)
	end
		Adds end bases (taa)
	acids
		Adds acids (e.g. Cys)
	nop
		Does nothing
	protein_db <id>
		Fetches a protein by the given id from www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
	tail <lenght>
		Adds a tail of "a" of the given length
	point <name>
		Marks a point in the code. This and the position of it will be shown
		when it gets compiled
	pad <length>
		Does the same thing as tail but is used to pad inside the code and not
		at the end
	snippet <id>
		Inserts a snippet by the given id. Snippets can be build with toolbox and are stored
		in the database directory
	cap
		Adds the 2 bases cap at the start
	linker
		Adds the gcatatgact linker which can be useful for printing
		(used in the Sars-CoV-2 vaccine)
	iupac
		Unpacks the bases from iupac compressed code
	; <text>
		Everything after a ";" is ignored. You can use it for comments.
